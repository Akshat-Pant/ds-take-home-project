    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we shall look at how **Variance** of a random variable is used to calculate **Covariance** and **Correlation**, two key measures used in Statistics for finding the relationships between random variables. These measures help us identify the degree to which two sets of data tend to deviate from their expected value (i.e. mean), in a similar way. Based on these measures, we can identify if the two variables are dependent on each other, and to what extent. This lesson will help you develop a conceptual understanding, go through some necessary calculations and some precautions while using these measures. \n",

    "## What is Variance ($\\sigma^2$)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we talk about covariance , it is imperative that we get some idea around **Variance** of a random variable. Variance refers to the __spread of a data set__. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __Variance is a measure used to quantify how much a random variable deviates from its mean value__. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we calculate variance, we are essentially asking, \"__Given the relationship of all given data points, how much distant from mean do we expect the next data point to be?__\"  This \"distance\" is called the **error term**, and it's what variance is measuring. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, these two data sets have exactly the same mean (10), but are obviously quite different: [0, 8, 12, 20] and [8, 9, 11, 12].<br>\n",
    "So what is different about these two sets? It is the spread of the data that is different. The Variance ($\\sigma^2$) of a data set is a measure of how spread out the data is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is shown using notation $\\sigma^2$. Previously, we have seen $\\sigma$ as a measure of standard deviation within a given dataset. Remember standard deviation is also a measure of spread of data. __Variance is simply the square of standard deviation (Or we could say standard deviation is is the square root of variance)__. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Calculate Variance? \n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is calculated by:\n",
    "1. Taking the differences between each element in a data set and the mean, \n",
    "2. Squaring those differences to give it a positive value\n",
    "3. Dividing the sum of the resulting squares by the number of values in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x-\\mu)^2}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, \n",
    "\n",
    "$x$ represents an individual data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mu$ represents the mean of the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "$n$ is the total number of data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that while calculating a **sample variance** in order to estimate a population variance, the denominator of the variance equation becomes **n - 1**. This removes bias from the estimation, as it prohibits the researcher from underestimating the population variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following illustration summarizes how spread of data around mean (10) relates to the variance. Wider curves correspond to increasing variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/var2.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting Variance \n",
    "\n",
    "Variance cannot be negative. It can only be equal to or greater than 0. A variance value of zero represents that all of the values within a data set are identical. The larger the variance, the more spread in the data set. A large variance means that the numbers in a set are far from the mean and each other. A small variance means that the numbers are closer together in value. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following graphs for Conglomo, Inc. and Bilco, Inc. These graphs show the theoretical frequency distributions of the monthly returns for each firm's common stock as though the returns were normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/var.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Conglomo's distribution of returns is more concentrated than Bilco's, as illustrated by Conglomo's relatively narrower bell curve. A more concentrated distribution is defined as having a smaller standard deviation. The distribution curve appears **higher, steeper, and narrower** because more observations are occurring **close to the expected return**. Bilco's distribution is rather **flat**, reflecting that its returns are less concentrated, or more dispersed, than those of Conglomo Inc.\n",
    "Most people are risk averse, in that they wish to minimize the amount of risk they must endure to earn a certain level of expected return. __A risk-averse investor would clearly prefer Conglomo's stock because its distribution of returns is more concentrated around the expected value of return.__"

    "Above, we saw how covariance can identify the degree to which two random variables tend to vary together, while using a formulation that depends on the units of the variables $X$ and $Y$. So, if different experiments contain underlying data measured in different units, covariance measure will not produce comparable results. For this, we need to normalize this degree of variation into a standard unit, with interpretable results independent of the units of data. We achieve this with a derived normalized measure, called correlation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation is defined as covariance, normalized by the product of standard deviations of $X$ and $Y$. This normalization helps us set the scale from -1 to 1. So the correlation between 𝑋 and 𝑌 would be calculated as:\n",

    "In data science practice, we typically tend to look at correlation rather than covariance because it is more interpretable, since it does not depend on the scale of either random variable involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Correlation Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "__Coefficient of correlation__, r, called the linear correlation coefficient, measures the strength and the direction of a linear relationship between two variables. It is also called as __Pearson correlation coefficient__. \n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, we measure four types of correlations for detailed relationship analysis: \n",

    "* Point-Biserial correlation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we shall focus on Pearson correlation as it is the go-to correlation measure for most needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Pearson r__ correlation is the most widely used correlation statistic to measure the degree of the relationship between two linearly related variables. For the Pearson r correlation, both variables should be normally distributed (normally distributed variables have a bell-shaped curve). Other assumptions include linearity and homoscedasticity. Linearity assumes a straight line relationship between each of the two variables and homoscedasticity assumes that data is equally distributed about the regression line.\n",

When the DOW Jones gains 5%, the S&P 500 usually gains around 5% because they are **highly correlated**.\n",

    "#### Optimization for E-retailers\n",

For example, an e-retailer wants to compare a number of secondary success events (e.g., file downloads, product detail page views, internal search click-throughs, etc.) with weekly web revenue.

Next, we shall see how we can use correlation analysis to run a __regression analysis__ and later, how covariance calculation helps us with dimensionality reduction. "
